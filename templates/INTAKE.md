## 8. Routines
*Ask: What could run on a schedule, and at what exact time? When should it stay quiet? Which should the bot suggest switching on?*
All routines start **OFF**. During setup the bot asks which to switch on and switches each on only with the user's yes (each run uses tokens).
Anything date-driven (a renewal, a deadline, an expiry) becomes a daily check at a fixed time that stays quiet unless something is due — so the question to ask is "what time of day should it look, and how far ahead?", not "on which dates?".
| What | Exact time (owner's time) | Stay quiet when | Suggest switching on at setup? |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
Routines question wording (short): ____
